# Inspiration: No code rule

"Data beers" rules do not allow to show code.  But data is the same as code!

- cf. [homoiconicity in Lisp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity#Homoiconicity_in_Lisp): Lisp statements are the same as Lisp lists!

- cf. [Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), "Rule of Representation": fold logic into data to have robust programs

# Where is there a lot of code? Github
